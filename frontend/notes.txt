What I'm going to do on Saturday--

1. Connect to mongo
2. Update a database
3. Create tables for question difficulties
4. Add the questions and possible answers to those tables
5. See if I can push and pull from those questions when accessing a different difficulty
6. Test if they can compare the answers correctly
7. See if they can push to a leaderboard
    a. Make correctAnswers > time
    b. Else if time > correctAnswers===correctAnswers
8. See if leaderboard keeps the data when refreshing
9. Test times and correctAnswers to see if a name can be pushed down/updated
10. If everything works rename leaderboard results as: ({name} answered {number} out of 10 questions correctly with a time of {time}!)
