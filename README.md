this is our group milestone project

We are creating a math quiz that has 10 questions with a highscore of correct answers out of the total and how fast it can be completed.

Making the skeleton of the page (front-end first) 
    -Leaderboard Top 10 (updated) (link to --> ) 
        -Full Leaderboard (max 50 per page) 
        -Filtering (extra) -Correct Answers 
        -Fastest times 
            -Alphabetical 
    -Title 
    -Difficulty Settings (link to --> ) 
        -Start Button 
    -How to Play (link to --> ) 
        -Description Button -(Extra) 
    -Different genres of quizzes 
        -History 
        -English
Make skeleton of back-end 
    -Leaderboard Memory 
        -Scores 
            -Users 
            -Times 
    -Randomize Questions 
        -Order of questions 
        -Order of answers 
        -Which of the questions are populated (have 20 but only populate 10) (extra) 
        -Correct/Incorrect Comparisons 
        -Questions in an array -Compare answer to selected answer 
        -Determine if true/false
Use a database table for the Leaderboard 
    -Utilize back-end Leaderboard skeleton for this 
        -See if the order matches with times, correct answers, and users in table 
        -Make sure it populates on main page 

Tasks ---> Day 0 
    -Set up project skeleton's skeleton 
    -Set up tasks 
    -Create further ideas

Tasks ---> Day 1 
    -Jade 
        -Create Links to each page 
    -Richard 
        -Tag-along with Jade 
    -Ray 
        -Leaderboard structure with pages and random scores (include names, time, questions answered) 
    -Twedty
        -Questions, possible answers, answers in array 
        -Randomize questions 
        -Create extra questions and only populate a certain amount (10 populated 20 created)

Tasks ---> Day 2 (once Day 1 is over) 
    -Jade 
        -Link responses to Leaderboard? 
    -Richard 
        -Tag along with Twedty 
    -Ray 
        -Maybe work on the memory and how the Leaderboard retains information 
    -Twedty 
        -Compare and Contrast right and wrong answers

COMPLETED TASKS (WRITE NAME WHEN COMPLETED) 
-Leaderboard 
    -Does it populate? 
    -Does it stay? 
    -Can it be updated? 
    -Can a user be replaced and then pushed down? 
    -Can we access more than 10? 
    -Can we show pages of 20 and then go to the next page? 
-Questions 
    -Are there questions with answers? 
    -Is it randomized? 
    -Are the suggested answers randomized? 
    -Can it be compared to the right answer? 
    -Does it add a point for each right answer? 
    -Can it give a total score for each question? (2/10, 10/10, etc) 
-Links 
    -Can we access the pages? 
    -Does each page have the correct data? 
    -Can we go back home? 
    -Does the submit button submit the data to leaderboard? 
-Memory 
    -Does the leaderboard retain its information? 
    -Does the timer work? 
    -Can the order of the leaderboard be updated?

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
