# Milestone_Prooject_2

this is our group milestone project

We are creating a math quiz that has 10 questions with a highscore of correct answers out of the total and how fast it can be completed.

1. Making the skeleton of the page (front-end first)
    -Leaderboard Top 10 (updated) (link to --> )
        -Full Leaderboard (max 50 per page)
            -Filtering (extra)

        -Start Button
    -How to Play (link to --> )
        -Description Button
    -(Extra)
        -Different genres of quizzes
            -History
            -English
2. Make skeleton of back-end
    -Leaderboard Memory
        -Scores
        -Users
        -Times
    -Randomize Questions
        -Order of questions
        -Order of answers
        -Which of the questions are populated (have 20 but only populate 10) (extra)
    -Correct/Incorrect Comparisons
        -Questions in an array
        -Compare answer to selected answer
        -Determine if true/false
3. Use a database table for the Leaderboard
    -Utilize back-end Leaderboard skeleton for this
    -See if the order matches with times, correct answers, and users in table
    -Make sure it populates on main page

    -Twedty
        -Questions, possible answers, answers in array

        -Create extra questions and only populate a certain amount (10 populated 20 created)

Tasks ---> Day 2 (once Day 1 is over)
    -Jade
        -Link responses to Leaderboard?
    -Richard
        -Tag along with Twedty
