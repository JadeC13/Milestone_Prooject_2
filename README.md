# Mathlympics
welcome to our milestone-project 2 github repository! This app was created by Jade Chalco, Rahman Carney, James Twedt, and Richard Carino!

# What Is The Mathlympics?
Our app, The Mathlympics, is a quiz app that puts your math knowledge to the test! Upon starting our quiz, you are given ten multiple choice questions to answer while the game keeps track of how long you take to answer each question.

# What Is Our App Doing?
Upon starting our app, you are given a home page. From there you can start our quiz, or view our leaderboard. If you start our quiz you are given ten questions to answer. We have twenty questions total that our app randomizes and chooses ten from to display on the quiz page. From there you may click the submit button or the home button. If you click submit you are then taken to our summary page where you are told how many questions you answered correctly and how long it took you to take the quiz. From there you click the OK button and are taken to the leaderboard.

# Problems We Encountered
Our first week working on this project went great. We divided up our tasks and checked off our to-do lists pretty fast. We figured the best way to go about it was to complete our frontend first and then move on to the backend. Backend was our biggest struggle and unfortunately we were not able to properly figure out our backend in time. We were able to get our application connected to mongo, we tested out some routes that worked on postman, however we were not able to properly store and display player data onto our leaderboard. I think our biggest downfall was doing our frontend first and then doing backend last. 

# What We Hope To Add In The Future
Moving forward with our application we would like to have a fully working and connected backend that actually displays user scores onto the leaderboard. We also would like to add a difficulty system to our quiz, and as a little easter egg we really want to add different variants of our quiz that reflect each one of us on the team. For example, Jade's math quiz would change the css to match her style and her questions would math related questions that focus on her interests.
